These are projects being worked on by other people, that are sufficiently exciting for me to check up on them often. You might find something here that interests you too.

[Playbit](https://playb.it/) — A DOM-like data structure for building collaborative software that works just as well while connected to the Internet as when running offline locally.

[Seeds of Science](https://www.theseedsofscience.org/) — A new scientific journal and community that aims to address issues in the publishing landscape by providing a peer-reviewed platform for non-traditional scientific writing.
