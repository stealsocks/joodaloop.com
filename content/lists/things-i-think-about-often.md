I originally planned to call this page "Things I Care About", but soon realised that the things that crossed my mind frequently were not necessarily things I intended to think about, let alone care for. Egregores are rarely considerate enough to request permission.

If you see a common thread running through all of these things, please let me know, because I sure don't.

## Friends

Most other things come second.

## Information Architecture


Ways of creating information, and how they influence the content itself.

## Incremental Moonshots

There was a praticular type of idea I've been trying to point at for a while, but couldn't find the right name for. The closest I'd got was "marginal revolution", but that wasn't quite it.

Then I found Aaron's post on [incremental moonshots](https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2013/05/16/incremental-moonshots/) and was gifted the perfect term.

<div class=quote> "Moonshot thinking works for those in positions that offer them astronomical opportunities. But for the rest of us aspiring innovators, the approach can be unhelpful at best, and crippling at worst. When you’re not a billionaire or an executive of a massive corporation, innovation happens in small steps." <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronzlewis">Aaron Z. Lewis </a> </div>


## Markets & Distribution

I've written before on the many limits of [markets](https://bewrong.substack.com/p/markets-are-mostly-fake) , as seen in the real world.


### Market-making

And it goes by many names:

*   Ben Thompson calls it aggregation theory,

### Job markets

Work is too big a part of life for anyone to not give up a bunch of brainspace to it. These are some of the questions I keep coming back to:

*   Why are job markets so damn [inefficient](https://danluu.com/hiring-lemons/) ?

## Mediums & Constraints

There are mediums that shape the very forms of our thoughts and ideas everyday, but are simply taken for granted. Things like sentences, subtitles, tweets, and [literacy itself](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164515.Orality_and_Literacy). I find this shit fascinating.

I get unreasonably excited every time I come across a new one, or when I get to experiment with particularly fun constraints.

## Sad Teenagers

<!-- Will the trend come back down in 2023? I hope so, but I wouldn't bet on it. -->

You could doubt the trustworthiness of the data, or even the effectiveness of survey methodologies, but that feels a little like burying one's head in the sand.

My current hypothesis is a combination of "people don't do enough things together anymore" and the [death of stories](https://www.praxissociety.com/journal/on-stories-and-histories).

## Software That Is Good

We can do better. Here are some concrete ways.

### Local-first software

How do we design softare that depends less on the cloud and gives ownership + control back to users? As a further benefit, apps also get more robust to network failures and collaboration glitches.

The folks at [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/) seem to be working at the forefront of this niche. I'd like to know who else is interested in similar ideas.

### Sharing data across apps

Modern data silos are artifacts of the SaaS approach of creating and selling products.

## Suffering

I'm not a big fan of pain-free hedonic utopias, but I do think we should do what we can to make chronic, debilitating pain a thing of the past. Some kinds of suffering are [much, much worse](https://qualiacomputing.com/2019/08/10/logarithmic-scales-of-pleasure-and-pain-rating-ranking-and-comparing-peak-experiences-suggest-the-existence-of-long-tails-for-bliss-and-suffering/) than others.
