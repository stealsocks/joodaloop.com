This is not supposed to be a guide to writing well, or doing research, or working faster. It is simply a look what my current process looks like most of the time for all the different kinds of writing I dabble in. But maybe it will help you do the former too.

I subscribe to the [anti-note-taking](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/notes-against-note-taking-systems) school of thought. Heck, I think most tools for thought are a [mistake.](https://borretti.me/article/unbundling-tools-for-thought)

Essays
------

**Tools:** Bear, Scapple

These are long-form posts that make it onto my main Subsack, ranging between 2000-5000 words.

All posts start of as drafts in Bear. Usually just as a title and a couple lines of context (explanation, link to tweet or post, a question). And it might stay this way forever.

If it does develop, it happens whenever I happen to think about

Some posts flow right out of you from the moment you start writing them. Manifestoes, rants and screeds. All you need is 3 empty hours and 70+ WPM.

But the serious stuff is different. The hardest part of writing 3000+ word essays, and saying everything that you want to say in a way that fits together well, is structure. Things get much, much easier once you know how each idea should lead into the next. This is where Scapple comes in.

These are outlines for two seperate posts.

You could all of this on like, paper and notepad++. Or just start typing the whole thing out on your iPad (this is how I started out). But I like paying for good software, and so I bought and used them.

Ways in which bear is better (link detection, copy-paste doesn't copy blank text)

Weekly letters
--------------

I have an open page in Bear called Weekly where I jot down random talking points that I might possibly want to expand upon later.

Every Saturday evening, I open up a new page in Bear, pick the topic from the Weekly page, and start typing.


Site pages
----------

**Tools:** Sublime Text, Taskpaper.

Taskpaper contains a running list of new page ideas, design choices, or additions to existing pages.


Tweets
------


## Code

**Tools:** Sublime Text, VSCode, Taskpaper.

If it doesn't need a server or framework, it happens in Sublime.
