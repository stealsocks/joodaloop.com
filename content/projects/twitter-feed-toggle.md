Originally built for [@ashishgpt2](https://twitter.com/ashishgpt2/), the extension acts as a toggle for hiding/showing your timeline. You can still run searches, draft tweets and access your bookmarks while the timeline is hidden.

It isn't available on the Chrome extension store yet, because I don't feel like paying their $5 registration fee. But you can download [the extension](https://github.com/stealsocks/twitter-feed-toggle) and set it up yourself.

I recommend using it in conjunction with [Simplified Twitter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simplified-twitter/kfopmjhmejbgomgeajemgpgpbckpoopg).

### How to use:

1. Download the [.zip file](https://github.com/stealsocks/twitter-feed-toggle) and extract it.
2. Go to the your browser's Manage Extensions page.
3. Toggle "Developer Mode" on.
4. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the extension folder you just extracted.
5. By default, your Twitter timeline will be hidden, but you can click the extension icon to toggle it on and off.
