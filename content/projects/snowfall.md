Short script to generate animated falling objects on webpages. Automatically adjusts the number of snowflakes to the size of the screen, and renders emojis as clean ASCII characters. 

**Warning**: Using too many large, complicated shapes can slow down your page.

### How to use:
1. Go to the [snowfall.css](https://snowfall.joodaloop.com/) page.
2. Choose the shape, color and size and density of your snowflakes. *(Note: You can choose decimal values for the number parameters)*.
3. Copy the script tag that's generated and paste it into your webpage.
