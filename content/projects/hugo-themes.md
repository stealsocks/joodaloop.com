I haven't really tried many other SSGs, but that's because [Hugo](https:/gohugo.io) is usually able to do whatever I expect it to, and more. If I was trying to turn you into a Hugo convert, I'd mention how it's [blazing fast](https://www.zachleat.com/web/build-benchmark/), has all the configurations you'd ever need, and let's you design everything in simple HTML + CSS. 

But instead, I'll just say that moving to Hugo lets you use any of these themes I've made for it, and they're really good ones. 

## collison

A simple [theme](https://github.com/stealsocks/collison) that reproduces Patrick Collison's website design, but with a responsive layout for mobile ([demo](https://collison.netlify.app/)).

## Gapat

A [theme](https://github.com/stealsocks/gapat) designed for [@ashishgpt2](https://twitter.com/ashishgpt2/), now available with an MIT license. 

Built for a focus on short, roughly sketched-out notes ([demo](https://gapat.netlify.app/notes/)) instead of chronological blog posts.
