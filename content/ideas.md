Some of these ideas are for improving things. Some are for making things worse. I'm not going to tell you which ones are which.

Some of these plans seem pretty sensible. Some seem kinda ridiculous. The latter ones are the plans I take most seriously.

## Public letters

<div class="box-header"> More people should write public letters </div>

Robin's newsletter is great, there are very few writers whose writing I await as eagerly.

All mediums have their constraints, whether they be essays, tweets or full-length papers. The cool thing about trying out a new one is that you don't know how it will change what you can say.

## Trainable

<div class=box>
<div class="box-header" > What rare skills are actually very trainable? </div>

Some jobs are over-indexed on experience and . Usually management, operations and executive roles.

And while it is true that experience is the best teacher for many aspects of these jobs, it doesn't make much sense to delay entry into these roles. The faster they start working, the better they'll get. 

Operations seems like a pariticularly salient example here. It might just be that only a tiny percentage of high-agency individuals with a strong network would be good at these jobs. But it might also be the case that there are small lessons that you could teach pretty quickly that would make a huge difference to fresh hires.

## After newsletters

<div class=box>
<div class="box-header"> What comes after the email newsletter? </div>

The point of most newsletters is to establish a direct connection with readers, users, or customers, removing the need for them to find you through search engines (unreliable) or whenever they remember to visit your site (rare). And a very long time, they were really good at doing that.

Now everyone has a newsletter, from your hosting provider to the local shitposter. For people sending them out, the playing field has gotten extremely crowded. How do you stand out? Can we find new ways to accomplish the same goal (sending people updates)?.

For consumers, there are a different set of problems. The traditional email inbox is a chronological-ordered list of messages. All of them, in one long list! This design choice is fairly archaic and mirrors the way you would receieve actual letters (all in one letterbox), but it shouldn't have to be the digital default. 

How do you create better ways to sort, read and triage email? How do you prioritise the sensers you want to hear from, and facilitate better conversations with them?

	
- Auto-sorting: Gmail splits emails into Social, Updates, Forumes and Promotions </li> 
- Better subject lines: Let me know exactly what the email is about, and how it's special, before I open it. With a focus on the latter.
- A worklog/updates/offers page: Let people go through a list of updates during a single visit instead of recieving them one at a time. Many things are not time-sensitive enough to merit an email update.</li>

## Working styles

<div class=box>
<div class="box-header"> Accounting for working styles </div>

We're still stuck with the 9-5 model for most jobs.

Some people want to sleep in the office. Others. Some only start functioning past 11PM.

So far, the way to do deal with has been "suck it up, wuss". Which is fair, employers want a dependable team.

## Everything I Know

<div class=box>
<div class="box-header"> Everything I Know About X </div>

If I ever start a YouTube channel, this is what I want it to be:

- Long-ish videos (30m - 1 hour) of me explaining everything I know about a topic that I have no "real" expertise in. 
- The camera points downwards on large sheet of paper (or whiteboard) that I draw on while talking.
- Minimal editing, but keep the audio and video quality high. 

The point is not to provide a particularly accurate or well-thought-out lecture, but the kind of personal perspective only a fairly experienced amateur can give. Stuff that isn't exactly the right method, or idiosyncratic enough to be useless to most people.

True experts have a really specialised understanding of their field, and have usually long since forgotten what it's like to be new to it. More importantly, they have an "expert's duty" to say only what they believe is true, and is usually common knowledge. 

Until I do get around to doing this, I'll try to add posts to the Useful section. If *you* try something like this, please send it to me, I'd love to see it.

	<div class="box-header" id="Software billing"> Ways to charge for software</div>

	 Reading this post by Adam Wiggins reminded me that the space of possible methods of charging for software products/services is still largely under-explored. This list is ranked in rough order of popularity. 

	Of course, most products use some combination of these methods, split across pricing tiers (usually: hobby, pro, enterprise).

	 <u>Per user billing</u>: Total price scales linearly with number of users, with discounts for higher volumes. Incredibly popular way to price enterprise SaaS.

	<u>Ad-based revenue models</u>: Sucks, but powers much of the free web. 

	 <u> Usage-based pricing</u>: Charge based minutes used, requests made, compute harnessed, etc. Is the default method among almost all server providers and API companies.	

	<u> Pay what you want</u>: Have everything be free, but give people the option to pay as much (or as little) as they feel like. I use this for Do100Things and minutes.page.

	<u> Charging per copy</u>: Pay for each copy of the software that you download, it was how things worked back in the days of <code>.exe</code>. The difficulty in ensuring recurring revenue with this kind of billing has caused it to fall out of favour. But some of my favourite pieces of software (Taskpaper and Scapple) still use it. 

	<u>Per unit pricing</u>: Some apps have a clear atomic unit, upon which all action is based. (pages, songs, documents). Charging small amounts (a few cents) per unit used/created lets customers pay for exactly how much they use. This might be interesting to try with Linkbasket.

	 <u> Transparent revenue</u>: On first glance, this doesn't seem to change what users get for their money; they still recieve certain features based on the tier that they buy into. But what they also get it the ability to see exactly how much their payment matters to the vendor. Are.na does this. 

	<u> Crowd-funding</u>: If you can get a bunch of people excited about your project, you can start charging them even before you've built anything. Often takes the form of Kickstarters, pre-orders or methods like ICOs and community-funding rounds.

	 Getting into YC is pretty-much a zero-signal achievement. Sure, the network is a big deal, and being in an environment that will push you is great too. But from the outside looking in, YC companies seem to have no real pedigree anymore.
	

	 Even claims of epostemic humility ring hollow. You don't need to be omniscient to know the team building another reading app will never be a $10B company.

	 A few of the stupider examples:

	 <a href="https://www.secretorum.life/p/the-myth-of-the-myth-of-the-lone">The Myth of the Myth of the Lone Genius</a> gets a lot of things right, as long as you restirict it's claims to domains of intellectual achievement. 

	 Outside of those fields, things get far more messy. 

	 Things die so easily. And it's incredibly hard for one person to do everything it takes to keep a project alive and growing.

	<p class=quote> "Projects are like plants. You need to water them almost every day. Not too much to drown them, not too little to starve them." — <a href="https://renegalindo.com/about/">rene galindo</a>

	 P.S: This is also what people who think GPT will lead to an explosion in number of succesful products are missing. Building is but one small part of keeping a venture up and running.  

	 <u>Enter collectives.</u> 

	Most of the entities that do end up accomplishing impressive things look more like teams, companies, gangs, and , than one dude going up against the world alone.

	 But <a href="">markets are not real</a>, and projects are not just the frictionless creative process they start out as. Details add up, and snowball into a grind.

	 Initially, there's going to be a lot of alpha in improving UX in these new mediums. Things like getting rid of video and the associated cognitive overhead, smart auto-mute/unmute, better online-offline signalling, .

	 You hear a lot about how remote teams require an order of magnitude more documentation and process. And it is true that the best teams so far are run like this, but this doesn't have to, and probably will not, be the case in the future. 

	 You need records, and smart enough AI tools to do the boring bits for you.
