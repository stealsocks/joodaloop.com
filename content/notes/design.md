I'm no professional. Insofar as I do care about good design, it is for the straightforward purpose of making things that are more beautiful than not. Any rules I have are usually stolen, and weilded lightly. 

## Typography

At first glance, it seems like a dry discipline, filled with rather boring rules about line-widths and parargraph spacings. 

But the effect that a simple font change can have is oft-underrated, and the first step in my process usually involves finding one that fits the vibe of the project. 


In moments of doubt, I simply return to the question: *"does this look like I want it to?"*. I'm still not sure about the answer for this site.

### Rules

1. Point size should be 10–12 points in printed documents, 15-25 pixels on the web.
2. Line spacing should be 120–145% of the point size.
3. The average line length should be 45–90 characters (including spaces). *In CSS, this is approximately 38rem.*
4. Put only [one space between sentences](https://practicaltypography.com/one-space-between-sentences.html).
5. Never choose Times New Roman or Arial, as those fonts are favored only by the apathetic and sloppy.
