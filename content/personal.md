I have a [newsletter](https://bewrong.substack.com/) that is read by some pretty cool people. My posts don't really have a common theme, other than the fact that I write about things that I think are fun. Some of the good ones:

[What Do Your Ideas Want From You?](https://bewrong.substack.com/p/what-do-ideas-want)  
[The Problem of Too Much Money](https://bewrong.substack.com/p/the-problem-of-too-much-money)  
[Form is Fake](https://bewrong.substack.com/p/form-is-fake)  

You can browse the longer list of selected writing on the [Essays](/essays) page.

[Four Feet](https://open.spotify.com/track/0ZucC4LM2jpU3bQTbqujhc) is the latest release from [Kitchen Inc.](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3lFcVnOvnxrbW78B25ilQQ) a musical collaboration with one of my friends, most of which happened on an iPad.

[One Hundred Songs](https://onehundredsongs.netlify.app/) is a more personal attempt at recording 100 instrumental pieces of music. I'm currently at 50/100, after starting in June of 2021.

[snowfall.css](https://snowfall.joodaloop.com/) — Add a snowfall (or anything-fall) animation to your webpage.  
[Linkbasket](https://linkbasket.xyz/) — Create a one-page location for link collections you want to share, with descriptions and topics. Currently in beta.   
[Hypertext as Literature](https://hypertextliterature.netlify.app/) — Some of my favourite internet writing.  
[Queuest](#) — ...

*These projects cost me ~$10 a month in server + domain costs, if you'd like to help with those you can like, [buy me a book](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/joodaloop) or become a [regular supporter](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/joodaloop/membership).*
