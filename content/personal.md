I have a [newsletter](https://bewrong.substack.com/) that is read by some pretty cool people. My posts don't really have a common theme, other than the fact that I write about things that I think are fun. Some of the good ones:

[What Do Your Ideas Want From You?](https://bewrong.substack.com/p/what-do-ideas-want)  
[The Problem of Too Much Money](https://bewrong.substack.com/p/the-problem-of-too-much-money)  
[Form is Fake](https://bewrong.substack.com/p/form-is-fake)  

You can browse the longer list of selected writing on the [Essays](/essays) page.
